You are a senior software architect + technical writer.

TASK
Create a complete, production-quality README.md for this HR Attendance & Payroll web app currently running on Replit with a PostgreSQL database.

GOALS OF README
1) Explain the system end-to-end (business + technical): what it does and how it works.
2) Document the full project structure and code ownership (where each feature lives).
3) Document setup, running locally, and deploying outside Replit (Vercel).
4) Explain database usage, migrations, and how to connect to an external free database.
5) Provide a confirmable checklist to migrate safely without breaking attendance logic (especially fingerprint handling and date/time logic).
6) Provide troubleshooting & common errors.

ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS
- The README must be accurate to the actual repository code: do NOT guess.
- Scan the codebase and extract real details:
  - frameworks (React/Vite/Next?), server (Express?), ORM (Drizzle?), DB tables, env vars, scripts
  - routes/endpoints
  - import/export Excel workflows
  - attendance processing engine logic entry points
  - any background jobs or cron (if any)
- Include Arabic terminology where relevant (الحضور والانصراف، الملخص، البصمة…).
- Use clear sections, bullet points, and code blocks.
- Include an “Architecture Diagram” in ASCII.
- Include “Data Flow” and “Workflow A→Z”.
- Include “Deployment on Vercel” steps that are realistic.
- Include “Free DB options” with recommended approach and exact env var examples.
- Include “Security notes” (even if auth is absent) and “Backup notes”.

WHAT TO ANALYZE IN THE REPO (MANDATORY)
1) Project layout:
   - /client, /server, /shared (or actual folders)
   - key files: schema, storage, routes, import screens, attendance processing logic
2) Package scripts:
   - npm scripts, build commands, dev commands
3) Environment variables:
   - DATABASE_URL, any Replit-specific variables, ports, etc.
4) Database:
   - ORM: Drizzle migrations? drizzle-kit config?
   - Tables: employees, biometric punches, attendance records, rules, leaves, etc.
5) Excel import/export:
   - Expected headers for fingerprint file (e.g., كود / التاريخ_والوقت)
   - Master data columns used (e.g., القطاع)
   - Output report structure (تفصيلي + ملخص)
6) Attendance engine:
   - How check-in/out is computed
   - How penalties work (تأخير، انصراف مبكر، سهو بصمة، غياب ×2)
   - How overtime is computed
   - Friday behavior (جمعة إجازة عادية / بدل يوم الجمعة count)
   - How special rules/custom shifts apply and scopes are parsed
7) Known constraints and gotchas:
   - timezones / midnight rollover rules
   - Excel date parsing pitfalls
   - sorting vs min/max punches

README STRUCTURE (MUST FOLLOW)
1) Project Title + One paragraph overview
2) Features (bullet list)
3) Screens / Pages (what each page does)
4) Business Rules Summary (with Arabic column names)
5) Data Flow & Workflow A→Z
6) Architecture (frontend, backend, DB) + ASCII diagram
7) Folder Structure (tree) + responsibilities per file
8) Database
   - tables overview
   - migrations / schema management
9) API Endpoints (table: method, path, purpose)
10) Excel Import/Export
   - Required file formats + examples of headers
   - Validation behavior
11) Local Development
   - prerequisites
   - setup steps
   - run commands
12) Deployment: Vercel
   - recommended approach (split or serverless)
   - build settings
   - env vars
   - routing notes
13) Database: Free External Options
   - pick 2–3 (Neon/Supabase/Render/etc.)
   - pros/cons + recommended one
   - exact DATABASE_URL format examples
14) Migration Checklist (Replit → Vercel)
15) Troubleshooting (common errors)
16) Roadmap (optional)
17) License/Contributing (basic)

DEPLOYMENT CONSTRAINTS (IMPORTANT)
- If the current backend is Express, Vercel needs either:
  A) Convert to Next.js API routes (serverless)
  B) Host backend separately (Render/Railway/Fly.io) and point frontend to it
- The README must propose the best option based on the repo (do not assume).
- Mention CORS config if frontend/backend split.

OUTPUT
Return only the full README.md content in Markdown, ready to commit.
Do not output code changes—only documentation.
